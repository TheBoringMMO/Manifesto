# Manifesto

This is the initial manifesto for the boring mmo.
Why is it the boring mmo? that's because this mmo
is going to try to do the right thing for the players
by trying to be fair as fuck. The expectation is that 
if the mmo is balanced in as many ways as possible 
it will be dull as fuck. Secondly it's also boring because
I have not theme or story in mind. just systems and
rules to keep it all together.


# goals

1. make every thing you do in the mmo progress at the same pace
ie: xp per hour or gold per hour consistent as possible
2. do not limit socialization ie:, markets, servers, sharding
all these technical requirements for a positive experience
should not be a restriction
3. respect a players time. the time spent playing should
be positive and engaging
